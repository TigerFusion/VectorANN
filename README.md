# VectorANN

Normally Classifier ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) use Matrices. This project uses vector based layers instead. It uses one input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer with the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function. With ReLU this ANN can usually solve complex problems in less than 3,000 Epochs.
